## Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
### The instruction needs to note:

!!! This project can only play on the Windows Terminal !!!
Because of the file path, it cannot play on mac or Java IDE.


### Bonus:
I found the value of agility may have problem. Since all heroes with agility larger than 500 cannot attacked by the monsters. 
(As professor mentioned that : You can assume that a hero has a probability of dodging an attack which can be calculated as: agility*0.002. )
